Never write a ViewModel class again! Conquer the world with clean dynamic UIs!

This library allows you to use the ultra-simple Model-View-Update architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more. It is a variation of [elmish](https://elmish.github.io/), an Elm architecture implemented in F#. Elmish was originally written for [Fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler) applications, however it is used here for applications using Xamarin.Forms.

-----
This library is inspired by [Elmish.WPF](https://github.com/Prolucid/Elmish.WPF), [Elmish.Forms](https://github.com/dboris/elmish-forms) and [elmish](https://github.com/elmish/elmish), written by [et1975](https://github.com/et1975). This project technically has no tie to [Fable](http://fable.io/), which is an F# to JavaScript transpiler that is great.
