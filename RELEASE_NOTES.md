BREAKING CHANGES: This release introduces many small breaking changes to provide better type-safety and reducing update calls when using events.
Please read the migration guide to know how to update to this new version (https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/Fabulous.XamarinForms/migration-guide-to-0.50.html)
