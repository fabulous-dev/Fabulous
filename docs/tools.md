Live Update
------

There is an experimental LiveUpdate mechanism available.  The aim of this is primarily to enable modifying the `view` function in order
to see the effect of adjusting of visual options.

At the time of writing this has been trialled with
* Visual Studio + Android (USB Device or Emulator)
* Visual Studio for Mac + Android (USB Device or Emulator)
* Visual Studio for Mac + iOS (USB Device or Emulator)

Some manual set-up is required.  The following assumes your app is called `SqueakyApp`:

1. Check your projects have a reference to nuget package `Elmish.XamarinForms.LiveUpdate` for all projects in your app.
   This is the default for apps created with templates 0.13.10 and higher. Do a clean build.

2. Uncomment or add the code in the `#if` section below in `SqueakyApp\SqueakyApp\SqueayApp.fs`:

       type App () =
           inherit Application()
           ....
       #if DEBUG
           do runner.EnableLiveUpdate ()
       #endif

3. If running on Android, forward requests from localhost to the Android Debug Bridge:

       USB:
           adb -d forward  tcp:9867 tcp:9867
       EMULATOR:
           adb -e forward  tcp:9867 tcp:9867

4. Launch your app in Debug mode (note: you can use Release mode but must set Linking options to `None` rather than `SDK Assemblies`)

5. Run the following from your core project directory (e.g. `SqueakyApp\SqueakyApp`)

       Windows (Android):

           cd SqueakyApp\SqueakyApp
           %USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\Elmish.XamarinForms.LiveUpdate\0.14.8\tools\fscd.exe --watch --webhook:http://localhost:9867/update 

       OSX (Android):

           cd SqueakyApp/SqueakyApp
           mono ~/.nuget/packages/Elmish.XamarinForms.LiveUpdate/0.14.8/tools/fscd.exe --watch --webhook:http://localhost:9867/update  

       OSX (iOS): Similar except use the explicit IP address of the emulator or device, e.g. 192.168.1.8, see the application log from launch

           cd SqueakyApp/SqueakyApp
           mono ~/.nuget/packages/Elmish.XamarinForms.LiveUpdate/0.14.8/tools/fscd.exe --watch --webhook:http://192.168.1.8:9867/update

Now, whenever you save a file in your core project directory, the `fscd.exe` daemon will attempt to recompile your changed file and
send a representation of its contents to your app via a PUT request to the given webhook.  The app then deserializes this representation and
adds the declarations to an F# interpreter. This interpreter will make some reflective calls into the existing libraries on device.

**To take effect as app changes, your code must have a single declaration in some module called `programLiveUpdate` or `program` taking no arguments.**  For example:

```fsharp
module App =
    ...
    let init() = ...

    let update model msg = ...

    let view model dispatch = ...

    let program = Program.mkProgram init update view
```

If a declaration like this is found the `program` object replaces the currently running Elmish program and the view is updated.
The model state of the app is re-initialized.

### Known limitations

1. The F# interpreter used on-device has incompletenesses and behavioural differences:

   1. Object expressions may not be interpreted
   2. Implementations of ToString() and other overrides will be ignored
   3. Some other F# constructs are not supported (e.g. address-of operations, new delegate)
   4. Some overloading of methods by type is not supported (overloading by argument count is ok)

   You can move generally move problematic constructs to a utility library, which will then be executed as compiled code.

2. Changes to the resources in a project (e.g. images) require a rebuild

3. Changes to Android and iOS projects require a rebuild

4. You can't debug interpreted code from the IDE using breakpoints, stack inspection etc.  Restart for that.

5. You may need to mock any platform-specific helpers you pass through, e.g.

       module App =
           ...
           let init() = ...

           let update (helper1, helper2) model msg = ...

           let view model dispatch = ...

       #if DEBUG
       // The fake program, used when LiveUpdate is activated and a program change has been made
       module AppLiveUpdate =
           open App

           let mockHelper1 () = ...

           let mockHelper2 () = ...

           let programLiveUpdate = Program.mkProgram init (update (mockHelper1, mockHelper2)) view
       #endif

       type App (helper1, helper2) = 
           inherit Application()
           ....

           // The real program, used when LiveUpdate is not activated or a program change has not been made
           let program = Program.mkProgram App.init (App.update (helper1, helper2)) App.view

6. There may be issues running on networks with network policy restrictions

### Troubleshooting

The LiveUpdate mechanism is very experimental.
- Debug output is printed to console by `fscd.exe`
- Debug output is printed to app-output by the on-device web server

Please contribute documentation, updates and fixes to make the experience simpler.
