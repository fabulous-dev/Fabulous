**Description**

Tawasal is a secure multi-purpose messenger and superapp, offering free voice, text, videoconferencing and lifestyle services to clients around the world. Tawasal introduces a full suite of exciting features with something for everyone, from live sports, text, broadcasts and giveaways, to payments and news services.

**Why they chose Fabulous?**

Our team at Tawasal was looking for cross platform solution that was stable & supported. When we started looking into what Xamarin has to offer, we came across Fabulous - and due to usage of modern & reactive MVU pattern, as well as the ability to build basically anything using native Xamarin.iOS / Xamarin.Android bindings (using less code & functional approach with F#), while still maintaining a large shared codebase our choice was surely Fabulous.
